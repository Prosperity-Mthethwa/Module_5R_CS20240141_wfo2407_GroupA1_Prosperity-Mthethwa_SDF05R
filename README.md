# [SDF05] CSS Magic Buttons
 
 **Project Outline**
 - On my custom styles, I targetted all my buttons and added a :hover to my class selctor in order to make the buttons change color and animate upwards when the cursor hovers over them.
 - On my animations I used a transform tag to scale the buttons up when the cursor hovers over them. i used a 1.2 scale up ratio so that the buttons scale up a little bit out of the page. 
 - I changed the background-color to each button and animated the buttons to change into gradient colors when hovered over. 
 - I made sure that each button has unique colors and a unique appearance. 
 - btn-1 and btn-3 used :hover to change the text color from black to white. 
 - Other things that i made sure to add were changes in the borders of the buttons, I made sure to make each button have a unique experience with their borders 
   - for btn-1 I removed the border completely usinng border none
   - for btn-2 I used :hover to change the color of the the border when the cursor hovers over the button.
   - for btn-3 I removed the border when the cursor hovers over the  button. 
 - To create the color motion of btn-3 i used the ::before to create the color bar, and then made the transform animation for when the cursor hovers over the button. 

 **Challenges**
 - For this project i didnt come across any problematic things that i couldnt handle, except for the fact that having to make each button different and perform differently was somewhat hard to excecute, but i was able to handle it. 

 **What I am proud of**
 - I am particularly proud of bieng able to make animations and understanding how to properly excecute gradients. 
 -I am very proud of the way my btn-3 turned out especially how the blue and white gradient turned out.
